 02 Jul 2018,★★★★½,Eli Hayes,"“You know what I think?"" she says. ""That people's memories are maybe the fuel they burn to stay alive. Whether those memories have any actual importance or not, it doesn't matter as far as the maintenance of life is concerned. They're all just fuel. Advertising fillers in the newspaper, philosophy books, dirty pictures in a magazine, a bundle of ten-thousand-yen bills: when you feed 'em to the fire, they're all just paper. The fire isn't thinking 'Oh, this is Kant,'…"
 30 Aug 2018,★★½,matt lynch,"I've grown impatient with this sort of formally precise, vaguely genre-inflected stuff all loaded with signifiers about thwarted masculinity and socioeconomic struggle, as if the occasional grace notes like a sunset dance add some layer of class to the thriller stuff, or as if hearing Trump on the radio and setting this near the North Korean border makes it remarkably political. Is this a pensive, deliberately paced exercise in suspense, ambiguity, and modernity or a 2 1/2 hour slog about a dork who takes out his frustrations on a bully? Does it matter?"
 40,Watched,2018,Lee Chang-dong is one of my favorite directors. He never disappoints.This is definitely one of the year's best. All three leads are wonderful. Always impressed by Lee's focus on the minutia and his ability to cover scenes in ways you've never seen before.

 15 Nov 2018,★★,kevinyang,"Beautiful cinematography and a great performance from Steven Yeun can't prevent this from being needlessly cumbersome and thoroughly exhausting to sit through. Strip away the pretty window dressing and arthouse veneer and you'll find a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, rote explorations of masculinity, and a lead character who is as blank of a slate as there can be — the last point is particularly problematic when your film is two and a half hours long. None of this outside of…"

 16 May 2019,★★★★★,Hungkat,"Let’s sign a petition for Lee Chang-Dong to adapt all of Murakami’s books into films because this man captures the essences perfectly: felines, wells, jazz, American literature, masturbation, sex, loneliness, brooding introspection, meandering mood, metaphorical dreams/illusions, female obsession, etc. A dead-or-alive Schrödinger cat, an invisible fruit getting peeled, a writer that doesn’t write, a well that nobody seems to remember, a woman who disappears, a man who’s constantly bored, a conundrum that doesn't get solved and a fire that leaves no ashes behind...Like seriously, what do you talk about when you talk about Burning?"

 14 Aug 2020,★★½,kailey,"i think that the best part of the whole movie- an eerily timed conversation between the protagonist and steven yeun about greenhouses- also crystalizes my major problem with this. as in the movie makes it really, really obvious to me that yeun is not only up to nothing good but also that the greenhouse is a really clear ""metaphor"" for the events that follow.

 01 Dec 2021,★★★★★,reibureibu,"Couldn't figure out why this film stuck with me so hard the first watch, back when all I knew was theater releases, A24, and shitty horror films. It's slow, boring, and nothing really happens until something does happen, then it's back to being slow and boring and nothing happening. But I could tell there was this imperceptible feeling within me that, for some reason, this movie understood me."
 12,Watched,,"i think Lee Chang-dong put it best himself when he described Jongsu as a ""Faulkner character living in a Murakami world."" he was shorthanding to say that the quiet, growing rage inside of Jongsu is an anger once suited for a simpler world, where things that looked like reasons or answers were more readily available. the postmodern world that we find ourselves in, now, does not offer that same solace. there's an oversaturation of ambiguity, and searching for meaning only…"
 02 Feb 2019,★★★★★,Wes,"neo-noir gone painfully nuclear. there's a pervasive, aching spirit that resides in the corners and frames and blue skies, people trapped by circumstance and the ambiguity of their search for release. reach out and you can almost touch it. there's an inescapable and resonant loneliness that's been shot unlike anything else i've seen in quite a long time. calling this slow burn feels weird, because from the very beginning there's already this insatiable desire to make you feel tense, when…"

Hae-mi asks him to look after her cat while she's on a trip to Africa. She then returns with a mysterious man, Ben. When Ben visits Jong-soo, he confesses his own secret hobby."

  31 Oct,★★★★½,Edgar Cochran,"Alienation is an endlessly complex topic, convoluted at a psychological level. Now add class consciousness to the formula, plus psycho-sexual dependence. It's a big chump to digest and yet Chang-dong Lee manages these topics in the most humane, gritty and realistic way possible. Metaphors collide in a sea of mysteriousness, characters are dissected to their primal instincts and fears, and the About Elly (2009) syndrome that can be tracked down all the way to Antonioni is the card played in…"

Can you think of a filmmaker better to adapt a Haruki Murakami work? I surely cannot. BURNING is both psychological and romantic slow-paced thriller about an introvert Lee (Yoo Ah-In) who works as a deliveryman, has a soft voice and tries to escape any social interactions; Ben (Steven Yeun) is a wealthy, suave and handsome young man with some interesting kinks; and finally Hae-mi…"

 25 Oct 2018,★★★,Jacob,"The only times I’ve thought about this since leaving the theater are when articles about how great it is pop up on my timeline. Burning is gorgeously shot and acted, but it left me with nothing to examine. It contains layers and multiple mysteries, sure, but they all peel back rather easily. What proves to be a very ambiguous viewing experience turns out to be rather direct in the end. This is shockingly overt, from the dialogue to the incredibly slow…"

A yawn triggered by fatigue and boredom, as I felt compelled to re-enter this empty void, an inescapable path, to understand the passionate game these two men play.

 15 Nov 2018,★★★½,Filipe Furtado,"As deliberate as Lee's other movies, but more focused and driven. Burning is not exactly a thriller, far too in love of its structural absences and ambiguities to quite build enough narrative momentum, but it is better shaped for suggesting one. It mixes two very old pulp tropes, the guy who meets a more succesful potentially sociopathic dude and can't fail to be enthralled by him (there's a lot of very good comedy of discomfort between Yoo and Yuen) and…"

But then the second half happened, and suddenly I realized I was watching one of the best films of the year. As soon as the end credits started rolling I immediately wanted to start the film over again, and dig deeper and deeper into it. I just know this one is going to stay with me for a while. Fantastic cinematography, brilliant performances, complex story where the smallest things have meaning."
 06 Jun 2020,★★★★★,linufoe,"“There is no right or wrong there, just the morals of nature.“"
 21 Nov 2018,★★★★,Josh Larsen,"A mysterious character study that grows into a somber, generational portrait. There is a soft sadness that permeates the film and steadily spreads, until it gradually devours each of the main characters. It may devour you."
 09 Mar 2020,★★★★★,Luca,"Perfectly captures the essence of Murakami. A dreamlike trance that makes you question what is real and what is paranoia. The droning of the sleepy jazz, and the muted vibrance of the dusk created and atmosphere that perfectly matched this story. The first half while somewhat visually similar to the rest of the movie perfectly flows from a light, yet well written drama, into  the hitchcockesque nightmare near the end. This film felt like a fever dream in the best way possible."
 04 Mar 2023,★★★★½,George Carmi,Burning has been on my watchlist for quite some time now and I am very upset with myself for putting it off this long. This is a very haunting and thought-provoking display of psychological story-telling. There's so much subtle tension and brilliantly written conversations that make Burning an eerie and mysterious experience.

 29 Apr 2019,★★★★,nick wibert,"Tense as hell and really well-acted.  It’s fitting that a movie titled Burning would be such a well-executed slow burn, but I’m sure I’m not the first person to make that incredibly insightful observation."
 21 Aug 2018,★★★★★,Aaron Michael,"There are no words that can accurately describe how great this is. After an eight year hiatus, Lee Chang-dong has returned with his most ambitious film yet (which is really saying something). Burning is an enigma; a cerebral puzzle that toys with genre in a way that feels both traditional and innovative, telling a story that encompasses the personal and political in a manner that will no doubt confound some audiences. Those willing to engage with how Burning obscures and reveals itself over the course of its 148 minute run time are likely to find one of the most rewarding cinematic experiences of the year."

 30 Apr 2022,★★★★½,Michael James,"What started as a relaxed romantic drama during the first act, later turns into a dark psychological mystery thriller with full of unsolvable ambiguity and deep abstract metaphors. Right from the moment this slow burn drama turns into an ambiguous cerebral puzzle, it starts to affect you on a deeper level raising your curiosity level and leaves you with a lot to chew on when it’s all said and done. The performances, soundtrack and cinematography are brilliant. Though it’s slow paced with a way too long runtime, the interesting narrative and top notch filmmaking makes it a highly worthy watch."

Maybe a bit of a category mistake to read Trump into an enigmatic SK thriller.

This is one of the most layered, immense, richly ambiguous films I've seen in recent memory. A story about the frustrations of caste divide, of the rich vampirizing the poor, and of the fantasies people chase that remain forever beyond their reach. BURNING is the decidedly dark, more bewildering version of THE GREAT GATSBY, specifically, how it epitomizes the sociology of wealth, of…"

Yet because of how off something may feel, you keep your eyes peeled to the screen, paying attention…"
 26 Jun 2023,★★★★,🎃Jerry McGlothlin🎃,"Fish out of water. Trying to make sense of what you were never meant to know: concepts inside a void of vexation, fluttering across the mind, in and out of cognition. A feeling like fire fraught with scorn aimed at a world made with you on the outside looking in, its blur of mysteries the crepuscular beacon of a slow, bizarre descent. Reality is merely a matter of placement and perception. You can’t swim on dry land."
 17 Jun 2021,★★★½,Ben,"Burning has a lot of tremendous qualities. The performances from the cast are top-notch, the film is breathtaking to look at, and masculinity, class, and the treatment of women within South Korea are explored compellingly. The film's central mystery is gripping at times, too, but I cannot help but feel like I could have been more invested had the characters possessed any redeeming qualities. It hurts to say that, too, because the other three Lee Chang-dong films I have seen…"

 20 Nov 2021,★★★★½,Kirai,"Burning is a film with an unparalleled sense of intangible dread. It's a very slow and challenging ""thriller"" dripping with melancholy. Almost fully devoid of joy, the story follows a thin love triangle as seen from the subjective perspective of the protagonist Jong-su.
